# Storyblok

The world's first headless CMS that works for both developers & business users.

Vue Storefront & Vendure provides an integration with [Storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/) based on `@vue-storefront/storyblok` package and [documentation](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/storyblok/).

It is already implemented in the [template-vendure](https://github.com/vuestorefront/template-vendure) repository in a [feat/storyblok-integration](https://github.com/vuestorefront/template-vendure/tree/feat/storyblok-integration) branch.

:::warning
This integration is only between Vue Storefront and Storyblok. We are working on creating a plugin for Storyblok that would allow you to fetch data from Vendure and use it in Storyblok (like fetch products and display them in Storyblok as content). Check this [issue](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vendure/issues/94) for details
